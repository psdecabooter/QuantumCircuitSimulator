I followed the article ["A Quantum Circuit Simulator in 27 Lines of Python"](https://barghouthi.github.io/2021/08/05/quantum/) from Professor Aws Albarghouthi. <br>
This repository serves more as a store of notes rather than something I built on my own. <br>
I highly encourage anyone viewing this repository to read the original article and check out the [QQQ](https://qqq-wisc.github.io/) group.
